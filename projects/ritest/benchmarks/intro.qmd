[Stata's `ritest`](https://github.com/simonheb/ritest) (by [Simon Heß](https://hesss.org/)) has been out for about a decade now, making it a trusted way to confirm that my own `ritest` implementation in Python works correctly. To strenghten the confirmation, I also compare results with [R's `ritest`](https://grantmcdermott.com/ritest/index.html) implementation (by [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/)). A second goal of this subsection is to compare performance across the three implementations under different scenarios. To be clear, this is not a competition, it would not make sense, in most cases, to choose a particular language just because of randomization inference performance. It is just interesting to see how the different implementations compare.

I'll not include all code here, just the critical bits. You can find complete code and data for all benchmarks in the [repository](https://github.com/tabareCapitan/ritest/tree/master/documentation/benchmarks).

There are more implementations of randomization inference than the ones I consider in these benchmarks. For example, in Stata, Alwyn Young has shared [code](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/YoungA/) to do randomization inference and confidence intervals. In R, Alexander Coppock, authored `ri2`, documented [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ri2/vignettes/ri2_vignette.html). I’ve not used these alternatives, but they seem like credible implementation you may want to consider.
