`ritest` provides fast randomization inference (RI) tools for linear models and arbitrary statistics. It supports weights as well as stratified and clustered designs. Reports coefficient confidence interval by default.


## Features

* Linear-model RI with efficient computation.
* Generic RI for arbitrary scalar statistics via `stat_fn`.
* Ultra-fast coefficient bounds and bands.
* Stratified, clustered, and stratified-clustered designs.
* Weighted least squares (WLS) support.
* Deterministic seeding, reproducible permutations.
