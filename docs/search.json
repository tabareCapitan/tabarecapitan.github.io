In this crowd initiative, we investigated the degree to which research findings in the social and behavioural sciences are contingent on analysts’ choices. To explore this question, we took a sample of 100 studies published between 2009 and 2018 in criminology, demography, economics and finance, management, marketing and organisational behaviour, political science, psychology, and sociology. For one claim of each study, at least five re-analysts were invited to independently re-analyze the original data. The statistical appropriateness of the re-analyses was assessed in peer evaluations and the robustness indicators were inspected along a range of research characteristics and study designs. Only 31% of the independent re-analyses yielded the same result (within a tolerance region of +/- 0.05 Cohen’s d) as the original report. Even with a four times broader tolerance region, this indicator did not go above 56%.

Under the premise that willful avoidance of information plays a role in this result, we propose a novel approach—pre-nudges—to make consumers more receptive to calorie information.

In line with predictions from our theoretical analysis, we test two pre-nudges in the context of menu labeling: one aims to increase self-efficacy, and the other one highlights the long-term health risks of overeating. In a large-scale laboratory experiment, we find that both pre-nudges reduce calorie information avoidance.

However, replication is costly, and it is infeasible to replicate everything. Accurate, fast, lower cost alternatives such as eliciting predictions from experts or novices could accelerate credibility assessment and improve allocation of replication resources for important and uncertain findings. We elicited judgments from experts and novices on 100 claims from preprints about an emerging area of research (COVID-19 pandemic) using a new interactive structured elicitation protocol and we conducted 35 new replications. Participants’ average estimates were similar to the observed replication rate of 60%. After interacting with their peers, novices updated both their estimates and confidence in their judgements significantly more than experts and their accuracy improved more between elicitation rounds. Experts’ average accuracy was 0.54 (95% CI: [0.454, 0.628]) after interaction and they correctly classified 55% of claims; novices’ average accuracy was 0.55 (95% CI: [0.455, 0.628]), correctly classifying 61% of claims. The difference in accuracy between experts and novices was not significant and their judgments on the full set of claims were strongly correlated (r=.48). These results are consistent with prior investigations eliciting predictions about the replicability of published findings in established areas of research and suggest that expertise may not be required for credibility assessment of some research findings.\n\n\nCoauthored with many others (Nature Human Behavior, 2024) | pdf • journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan large language models help predict results from a complex behavioural science study? 🔍\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: We tested whether large language models (LLMs) can help predict results from a complex behavioural science experiment. In study 1, we investigated the performance of the widely used LLMs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in forecasting the empirical findings of a large-scale experimental study of emotions, gender, and social perceptions. We found that GPT-4, but not GPT-3.5, matched the performance of a cohort of 119 human experts, with correlations of 0.89 (GPT-4), 0.07 (GPT-3.5) and 0.87 (human experts) between aggregated forecasts and realized effect sizes. In study 2, providing participants from a university subject pool the opportunity to query a GPT-4 powered chatbot significantly increased the accuracy of their forecasts. Results indicate promise for artificial intelligence (AI) to help anticipate—at scale and minimal cost—which claims about human behaviour will find empirical support and which ones will not. Our discussion focuses on avenues for human–AI collaboration in science.\n\n\nCoauthored as part of a large-scale collaboration with many others (Royal Society Open Science, 2024) | journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the trajectory of discrimination: A meta-analysis and forecasting survey capturing 44 years of field experiments on gender and hiring decisions 👷🏼‍♀️👷🏼‍♂️\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: A preregistered meta-analysis, including 244 effect sizes from 85 field audits and 361,645 individual job applications, tested for gender bias in hiring practices in female-stereotypical and gender-balanced as well as male-stereotypical jobs from 1976 to 2020. A “red team” of independent experts was recruited to increase the rigor and robustness of our meta-analytic approach. A forecasting survey further examined whether laypeople (n = 499 nationally representative adults) and scientists (n = 312) could predict the results. Forecasters correctly anticipated reductions in discrimination against female candidates over time. However, both scientists and laypeople overestimated the continuation of bias against female candidates. Instead, selection bias in favor of male over female candidates was eliminated and, if anything, slightly reversed in sign starting in 2009 for mixed-gender and male-stereotypical jobs in our sample. Forecasters further failed to anticipate that discrimination against male candidates for stereotypically female jobs would remain stable across the decades.\n\n\nCoauthored as part of an author-consortium with many others (Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 2023) | journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime-varying pricing may increase total electricity consumption: Evidence from Costa Rica ⚡\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: We study the implementation of a time-varying pricing (TVP) program by a major electricity utility in Costa Rica. Because of particular features of the data, we use recently developed understanding of the two-way fixed effects differences-in-differences estimator along with event-study specifications to interpret our results. Similar to previous research, we find that the program reduces consumption during peak-hours. However, in contrast with previous research, we find that the program increases total consumption. With a stylized economic model, we show how these seemingly conflicted results may not be at odds. The key element of the model is that previous research used data from rich countries, in which the use of heating and cooling devices drives electricity consumption, but we use data from a tropical middle-income country, where very few households have heating or cooling devices. Since there is not much room for technological changes (which might reduce consumption at all times), behavioral changes to reduce consumption during peak hours are not enough to offset the increased consumption during off-peak hours (when electricity is cheaper). Our results serve as a cautionary piece of evidence for policy makers interested in reducing consumption during peak hours—the goal can potentially be achieved with TVP, but the cost is increased total consumption.\n\n\nCoauthored with Alpízar, Madrigal-Ballestero, and Pattanayak (Resource and Energy Economics, 2021) | pdf • code • journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMPAs and Aspatial Policies in Artisanal Fisheries 🐠\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: Using a spatially explicit framework with low/middle-income country coastal characteristics, we explore whether aspatial policies augment the impact of marine protected areas (MPAs) and identify when MPAs create income burdens on communities. When MPAs are small and budget-constrained, they cannot resolve all of the marinescape’s open-access issues, but they can create win-win opportunities for ecological and economic goals at lower levels of enforcement. Aspatial policies—taxes, gear restrictions, license restrictions, and livelihood programs—improve the MPA’s ability to generate ecological gains, and licenses and livelihood policies can mitigate MPA-induced income burdens. Managers can use MPA location and enforcement level, in conjunction with the MPA’s impact on fish dispersal, to induce exit from fishing and to direct the spatial leakage of effort. Our framework provides further insights for conservation-development policy in coastal settings, and we explore stylized examples in Costa Rica and Tanzania.\n\n\nCoauthored with Albers, Ashworth, Madrigal-Ballestero, and Preonas (Marine Resource Economics, 2021) | pdf • journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimal siting, sizing, and enforcement of marine protected areas 🐠\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: The design of protected areas, whether marine or terrestrial, rarely considers how people respond to the imposition of no-take sites with complete or incomplete enforcement. Consequently, these protected areas may fail to achieve their intended goal. We present and solve a spatial bio-economic model in which a manager chooses the optimal location, size, and enforcement level of a marine protected area (MPA). This manager acts as a Stackelberg leader, and her choices consider villagers’ best response to the MPA in a spatial Nash equilibrium of fishing site and effort decisions. Relevant to lower income country settings but general to other settings, we incorporate limited enforcement budgets, distance costs of traveling to fishing sites, and labor allocation to onshore wage opportunities. The optimal MPA varies markedly across alternative manager goals and budget sizes, but always induce changes in villagers’ decisions as a function of distance, dispersal, and wage. We consider MPA managers with ecological conservation goals and with economic goals, and identify the shortcomings of several common manager decision rules, including those focused on: (1) fishery outcomes rather than broader economic goals, (2) fish stocks at MPA sites rather than across the full marinescape, (3) absolute levels rather than additional values, and (4) costless enforcement. Our results demonstrate that such naïve or overly narrow decision rules can lead to inefficient MPA designs that miss economic and conservation opportunities.\n\n\nCoauthored with Albers, Preonas, Robinson, and Madrigal-Ballestero (Environmental and Resource Economics, 2020) | journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeterminants of food insecurity among smallholder farmer households in Central America 🌽\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: To ensure food security among rural communities under a changing climate, policymakers need information on the prevalence and determinants of food insecurity, the role of extreme weather events in exacerbating food insecurity, and the strategies that farmers use to cope with food insecurity. Using household surveys in Guatemala and Honduras, we explore the prevalence of food insecurity among smallholder farmers on both a recurrent (seasonal) and episodic (resulting from extreme weather events) basis, analyze the factors associated with both types of food insecurity, and document farmer coping strategies. Of the 439 households surveyed, 56% experienced recurrent food insecurity, 36% experienced episodic food insecurity due to extreme weather events, and 24% experienced both types. Food insecurity among smallholder farmers was correlated with sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, education, migration) and asset ownership. The factors affecting food insecurity differed between type and prevalence of food insecurity. Our results highlight the urgent need for policies and programs to help smallholder farmers improve their overall food security and resilience to extreme weather shocks. Such policies should focus on enhancing farmer education levels, securing land tenure, empowering women, promoting generational knowledge exchange, and providing emergency food support in the lean season or following extreme weather events.\n\n\nCoauthored with many others (Regional Environmental Change, 2020) | journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold and community responses to seasonal droughts in rural areas of Costa Rica 💧\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: This paper describes the adaptive responses of rural households and community-based drinking water organizations (CWOs) during seasonal droughts in Costa Rica. It empirically characterizes the adaptive measures used by 3,410 households and 81 CWOs in the driest area of the country. Volumetric pricing is a powerful adaptation option for managing water scarcity during these periods. However, these pricing schemes are not properly set to recover costs for adequate investment in water infrastructure. As a result, many CWOs rely on external financial support to cover these investments. The financial and governance restrictions characterizing most CWOs must be overcome in order to implement most of the adaptation measures identified for preparedness against seasonal drought. On the other hand, some rural households use water sources in addition to the tap water provided by CWOs (e.g. bottled water), as well as water-storing devices (e.g. buckets). The lack of effective adaptation of CWOs to water scarcity, expressed by unreliable piped-water systems, would probably lead to a higher use of these alternatives. This would entail higher costs to households, due to the time and resources invested in these activities. These costs and the potential additional costs on health represent the social costs of community failures to adapt to drier scenarios in existing piped-water systems.\n\n\nCoauthored with Madrigal-Ballestero, Salas, and Córdoba (Waterlines, 2019) | pdf • journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine protected areas in Costa Rica: How do artisanal fishers respond? 🐠\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: Costa Rica is considering expanding their marine protected areas (MPAs) to conserve marine resources. Due to the importance of households’ responses to an MPA in defining the MPA’s ecological and economic outcomes, this paper uses an economic decision framework to interpret data from near-MPA household surveys to inform this policy discussion. The model and data suggest that the impact of expanding MPAs relies on levels of enforcement and on-shore wages. If larger near-shore MPAs can produce high wages through increased tourism, MPA expansions could provide ecological benefits with low burdens to communities. Due to distance costs and gear investments, however, MPAs farther off-shore may place high burdens on off-shore fishers.\n\n\nCoauthored with Madrigal-Ballestero, Albers, and Salas (Ambio, 2017) | pdf • journal"

Classical and other lyric-free music works well. I mostly use Brain.fm, which claims to create music that is “purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state”. I haven’t read the research, but it is supposed to have some real science behind it. All I can say is that it has been good for me. The “purpose-built” part also seems to work beyond deep focus, with modes for learning, creativity, chill, unwind, destress, sleep, and more.\nI still use it every day, but I have three issues with Brain.fm: no real desktop app (they only just released one for Mac), it’s hard to tell when (and if) new material comes out, and the price feels too high. On the last point, services like Spotify and Youtube Music return about 60-70% of revenue to right holders, while Brain.fm produces its own catalogue. Intellectual property rights don’t enter as a variable cost in the same way; it seems closer to a one-time cost to create tracks. I don’t know how expensive it is to make music for Brain.fm, but it’s almost certainly far cheaper than producing commercial songs. Yet the pricing doesn’t reflect those different cost structures. As of August 2025 in Sweden, you pay about USD 13.5/month for Spotify, USD 12.5/month for Youtube Music, and USD 10/month for Brain.fm (USD 5.8 if billed annually).\n\n\nIDE + Text editor\nVS Code, all the way. I use it for all my coding, which includes Python, Stata (with Stata Enhanced and StataRun), and R. I use it to build this website via Quarto. And I also use it for typesetting in LaTeX. Git for version control, with GitHub as the remote. I also use GitHub Copilot when it helps.\nIn the past I used Sublime, which remains a great lightweight text editor, but I prefer to have everything in one place. Before that, I had a good run with Atom (deceased).\n\n\nMail\nI use Gmail with three extensions: Simplify for a cleaner interface and lots of features, Inbox When Ready to hide the inbox when I don’t want to see it, and TeX for Gmail when I need to include equations.\n\n\nNote-taking\nI use Obsidian to write everything (except code) that I want to keep: papers, ideas, recipes, health notes, things I learn, and more.\nI added a few community plugins to Obsidian to make it more useful: Better Word Count, Dataview, Go to Heading, Hider, Homepage, LaTeX Suite, Pandoc, Quick Switcher++, QuickAdd, Remember Cursor Position, Templater, Text Snippets, TTS, Typewriter Scroll, and Zotero Integration.\nObsidian is flexible. You can make it look and act however you want. The developers are active and reasonable. The community builds and maintains a huge set of plugins. The roadmap is transparent. It isn’t open-source, but it has regular audits and a feasible business model, which gives me confidence in using it long term. The business model is simple: you only pay if you want sync or publishing. Because it’s funded directly by users, development can stay focused on product rather than outside pressures. Most importantly, notes stay in plain text Markdown files (see File over app). That means no lock-in.\n\n\nOrganization\nI use Workflowy for text that is meant to disappear: shopping lists, to-do lists, travel itineraries, and more. It’s a simple, fast, and flexible outliner that works well for quick notes and lists. I mostly like it because it is so simple and I can easily use it without touching my mouse. It’s been my main planning tool for a while.\n\n\nOS\nMy main OS is Fedora (Linux), which provides modern kernels and software alongside a clean upstream GNOME experience. Although somewhat sponsored by IBM through its Red Hat ties, development remains credibly independent. Ubuntu is convenient and user-friendly, though I prefer Fedora’s approach over Canonical’s Snap ecosystem. Linux Mint attempts to “clean” Ubuntu but still relies on Canonical dependencies. I have no concerns about Debian, but it may be too conservative for my needs.\nI’ve made few changes to Fedora’s default setup. Perhaps most useful, I made my shell (bash) a bit faster to use by adding zoxide for directory navigation.\nI also keep Windows (dual-boot with GRUB) for a few applications that lack Linux support, such as Garmin Express and BankID.\n\n\nSync and storage\nI use Nextcloud for file sync, hosted on Hetzner Storage Share (Hosted in the EU). It is a bit more complex to set up than alternatives like Dropbox, but it gives you so much control and flexibility for a fraction of the monthly cost (~20% of the current price of Dropbox for two users).\nNextcloud is open-source, so it can run on a self-hosted server or on any third-party provider. It has a large community and many plugins to extend its functionality. I do not use any of the Nextcloud apps, but I do use the Nextcloud Desktop Client to sync files across devices. Once setup is done, it works seamlessly in the background. Virtual File System (VFS) works well in Windows, although it is better to keep a separate sync folder with VFS enabled. As of August 2025, VFS does not work in Linux, but it is easy to mount a remote folder with WebDAV.\n\n\nWebsite\nThis site is built with Quarto, rendered locally, and deployed via GitHub Pages. Quarto handles the formatting and publishing workflow in Markdown and integrates directly with VS Code, which makes editing and updating simple.\n\n\n Disclaimer"
